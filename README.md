# Data-Analysis-on-Internship-Opportunities-with-Rprogramming-
This R programming project utilizes Kaggle data to analyze internship opportunities. The process involves data loading, cleaning, and analysis, including the removal of duplicates and handling missing values. The project explores key statistics such as mean and median stipends, visualizes internship distributions by location and duration through bar charts, histograms, and pie charts, and investigates company-wise internship counts. The use of ggplot2 and dplyr libraries enhances data visualization and manipulation. The project also includes a simple linear regression analysis. This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive overview of internship trends and serves as a valuable resource for data enthusiasts exploring the internship landscape.
